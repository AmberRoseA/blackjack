## How to play

Upon entering their name and confirming readiness to play, two sets of hands will be dealt for both the player and the dealer. Each will receive two cards, with one of the dealer's cards hidden from view. The player then takes their turn(s).

The total numerical value of the player's hand is displayed, and they are presented with the option to "Hit" or "Stick" (y/n).

* Choosing "Hit" deals the player another card from the deck. (Player can keep choosing Hit and recieve more cards as long as the total is under 21, otherwise game over)
* Opting to "Stick" allows the player to maintain their current hand value, prompting the dealer's turn.
Once the player decides to stick, all of the dealer's cards are revealed, and the dealer then decides whether to hit or stick.

The winner is determined by whoever has a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. Exceeding 21 results in a "Bust," signifying a loss.
